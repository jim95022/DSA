# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Data Structures
A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently 
and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient 
data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

## Algorithm
Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group 
of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed 
in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.

## How to learn DSA
1. Learn about Time and Space complexities
2. Learn the basics of individual Data Structures
3. Learn the basics of Algorithms
4. Practice Problems on DSA

## Learn about Complexities
1. Time Complexity: Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
   - The number of operations performed in the program, 
   - The speed of the device, and also 
   - The speed of data transfer if being executed on an online platform.
2. Space Complexity: Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities
   - Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data
structure.

## Asymptotic notation
> is a mathematical tool that calculates the required time in terms of input size and does not require the execution of 
> the code.

- *Big-O Notation (Ο)* – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
- *Omega Notation (Ω)* – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
- *Theta Notation (θ)* – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
